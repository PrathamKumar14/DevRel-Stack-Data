To use an API from the RapidAPI Hub, you will need to create an account. Some of the APIs that are available on the RapidAPI Hub offer freemium plans. So, you can try them out without adding your credit card details.

## Create a free RapidAPI account

You will need to create an account to test our APIs, integrate them into your applications, and track the analytics. You can sign up from the RapidAPI home page by clicking the **Sign Up button** in the top right.

## Find APIs that match your requirements

You can search for any kind of API in the RapidAPI Hub. However, if you are unsure about the type of API you are looking for, you can filter our categories or collections. You can also use our advanced search to find your desired API.

### Categories

Categories are a way to organize the APIs. When a new API is added to the RapidAPI Hub, a category is added to help others find that API. In the RapidAPI Hub, you will find various categories like [Data](https://rapidapi.com/category/Data), [Sports](https://rapidapi.com/category/Sports), [Finance](https://rapidapi.com/category/Finance), [Travel](https://rapidapi.com/category/Travel), [Entertainment](https://rapidapi.com/category/Entertainment), etc. You can also view all the APIs that belong to a particular category and search inside it.


### Collections

A collection is a list of APIs with similar characteristics like [Top Meme APIs](https://rapidapi.com/collection/meme), [Top Geocoding and Location APIs](https://rapidapi.com/collection/geocoding-location-apis), etc. An API can belong to multiple collections, and the RapidAPI team manages collections on the RapidAPI Hub. You can also view all the APIs that belong to a particular collection and search inside it.

### Advanced search

You can also use [our advanced search functionality](https://rapidapi.com/search/weather) to filter APIs based on categories, collections, verified, official, GraphQL, and Kafka API types.
