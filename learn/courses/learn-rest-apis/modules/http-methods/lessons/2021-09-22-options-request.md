[The OPTION request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS) method is used to obtain information about the communication options that are available between the requested URL and the server. The response to an OPTIONS request isnâ€™t cacheable.

An example of an OPTIONS request looks like this:

```bash
OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1
Host: https://www.website.com
```

The response to an OPTIONS request can be the following:

```bash
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
```

If [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is enabled on the server, [a preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) is sent with the OPTIONS method so that the server can respond if it can accept requests from the requested URL.
