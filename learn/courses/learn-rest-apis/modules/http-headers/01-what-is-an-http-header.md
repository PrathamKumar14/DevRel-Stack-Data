When a client makes a request to the server, the client can pass additional information as a part of the request via HTTP headers. As mentioned earlier, headers are case insensitive.

Headers can contain information about the type of data that the client is sending to the server. It can also contain information about authenticating a user agent with the server.

Headers can be grouped into four types based on their contexts:

1. Request headers
2. Response headers
3. Representation headers
4. Payload headers

We will discuss these types of headers in the next section.
