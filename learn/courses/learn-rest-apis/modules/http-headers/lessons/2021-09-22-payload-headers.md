[The Payload headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Payload_header) contain information about the payload like the length of the message, range of the resource carried in the payload, encoding, etc. This type of headers can be present in both the request and response messages.

Payload headers include the following:

- [Content-Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length)
- [Content-Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range)
- [Trailer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer)
- [Transfer-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding)
