Like the request headers contain information about the client, [the response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) contain information about the server from which the resource is requested. All headers in a response message can be called response headers.

Some response headers like [Age](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age), [Location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location) or [Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server) can give a more detailed context of the response.
