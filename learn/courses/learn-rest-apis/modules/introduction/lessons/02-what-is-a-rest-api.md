Roy Fielding created REST in 2000. REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are those APIs that follow the guidelines of REST architecture. They are also known as RESTful APIs.

Any API that follows the six rules of the REST architecture can be considered as RESTful APIs. We will discuss the principles of REST architecture in the next section.
