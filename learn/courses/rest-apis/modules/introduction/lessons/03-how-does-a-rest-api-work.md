A client makes a request to the server for a resource. The server returns the resource that the client requests as a response. The response is generally in a format that the client understands.

REST APIs generally communicate via HTTP requests. However, it isnâ€™t mandatory to use an HTTP request for a REST API.

## Anatomy of a Request

- **Endpoint:** The endpoint is the URL from which you request for a resource.
- **Method:** The method determines the type of request you make to the server. There are five popular HTTP methods that REST uses:
  - **GET** method is used to retrieve a response from the server.
  - **POST** method is used to create a new resource on the server.
  - **PUT** method can create or update a resource on the server.
  - **PATCH** method is used to update a resource on the server.
  - **DELETE** method is used to remove a resource from the server.
- **Headers:** The headers contain important information regarding the metadata of the request. Headers are case-insensitive by nature and can be grouped into request, response, representation and payload.
- **Data (or Body):** POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE methods can contain a body which is used to send information to the server.
