An API or Application Programming Interface is a set of guidelines or rules that state how applications interact. When you visit any website, the client or your browser requests the websiteâ€™s server. The server sends a response to the browser, and the browser renders the data on the screen. You can view the information that the server sends via the response. What the server will respond to depends on the request that the browser does.

Any type of application can use APIs to request data from a server. When you visit a website or view an application on your mobile device, the website or application uses various APIs to render the data.
