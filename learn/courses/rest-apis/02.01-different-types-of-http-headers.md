When a client makes a request to the server, the client can pass additional information as a part of the request via HTTP headers. As mentioned earlier, headers are case insensitive.

Headers can contain information about the type of data that the client is sending to the server. It can also contain information about authenticating a user agent with the server.

Headers can be grouped into four types based on their contexts:

## Request headers

In a HTTP request, [the Request headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) are used to pass information about the request. It contains information about the requested resource and the client which is making the request.

A request header can contain information about type of the request, the URL to which the request is being made, authentication details, cache policy as well as the user agent.

Some of the popular request headers are:

### Accept
The [Accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) HTTP header is used to inform the server about the type of data that the client is able to understand.

```json
Accept: text/html
Accept: application/xhtml+xml
Accept: image/png
```

### Accept-Encoding
The [Accept-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) HTTP header is used to inform the server about the type of encoding the client is able to understand.

```json
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Encoding: gzip, compress
```

### Authorization
The [Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) HTTP header is used to pass credentials which lets the server authenticate a client and provide access to protected resources.

```json
Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
Authorization: Bearer eyYWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
```

## Accept-Language
The [Accept-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) HTTP header is used to let the server know which local is preferred and understood by the client.

```json
Accept-Language: fr-CH
Accept-Language: en-US
```

### Cache-Control
The [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) HTTP header holds caching instructions for both the client and the server.

```json
Cache-Control: stale-while-revalidate=60
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

Use the interactive component below to understand the `Cache-Control` HTTP header from a `GET` request. Click on the **Submit** button to request a response from the server:

<HTTPClient
  method="GET"
  isRequestMethodChangeDisabled
  isResponseBodyVisible={false}
  isResponseHeadersVisible
/>

## Response headers

Like the request headers contain information about the client, [the response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) contain information about the server from which the resource is requested. All headers in a response message can be called response headers.

Some response headers like [Age](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age), [Location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location) or [Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server) can give a more detailed context of the response.

## Representation headers

[The Representation headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Representation_header) contain information about the resource body which is sent in a response.

Representation headers include the following:

### Content-Type
The [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) HTTP header is used to indicate the media type of the resource before any form of content encoding.

```json
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Use the interactive component below to understand the `Content-Type` HTTP header from a `GET` request. Click on the **Submit** button to request a response from the server:

<HTTPClient
  method="GET"
  isRequestMethodChangeDisabled
  isResponseBodyVisible={false}
  isResponseHeadersVisible
/>

### Content-Encoding
The [Content-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding) HTTP header is used to decode the message payload in order to obtain the original format of the payload. It is mainly used to do lossless compression of the payload.

```json
Content-Encoding: compress
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

### Content-Language
The [Content-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language) HTTP header is used to indicate the language intended for a particular type of audience. If no `Content-Language` is specified, then the content is intended for all language audiences.

```json
Content-Language: en-US
Content-Language: en-CA
```

### Content-Location
The [Content-Location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Location) HTTP header is used to indicate an alternate location for the response. Base on the `Accept` request header, the server can respond with different response headers.

```json
Content-Location: /documents/bar.json
Content-Location: /documents/bar.php
```

## Payload headers

[The Payload headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Payload_header) contain information about the payload like the length of the message, range of the resource carried in the payload, encoding, etc. This type of headers can be present in both the request and response messages.

Payload headers include the following:

### Content-Length
The [Content-Length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length) HTTP header is used to indicate the size of the message body in bytes.

```json
 Content-Length: 3495
```

### Content-Range
The [Content-Range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range) HTTP header is used to indicate the position of a partial message in a full body message.

```json
Content-Range: bytes 500-1000/*
```
