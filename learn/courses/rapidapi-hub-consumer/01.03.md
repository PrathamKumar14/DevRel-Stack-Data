The usage of an API can be tracked via [the Developer Dashboard](https://RapidAPI.com/developer/dashboard?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/learn&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel). You can track all your APIs, apps, billing, API quota usage, and API analytics from the **Developer Dashboard**.

You can also add new apps and APIs from the Developer Dashboard.
