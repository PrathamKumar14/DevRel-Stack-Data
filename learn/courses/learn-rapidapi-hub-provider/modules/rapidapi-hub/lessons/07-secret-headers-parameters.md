RapidAPI allows you to add **secret headers and parameters** which are sent on every request but are hidden from the API consumers.

![Secret Headers and Parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/dev/learn/courses/learn-rapidapi-hub-provider/images/image8.png)

There are mainly two uses for secret headers and parameters:

- You can use these hidden parameters to authenticate your API requests.
- You can use secret headers and parameters to set environment variables.

<Callout>
  The API consumer doesn't need to add anything extra for the secret headers and parameters.
