You can go through the interactive component below to understand the steps for integrating an API from [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/learn&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel).

Once you find the API you are looking for, you can visit that API's page on [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/learn&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) and click on the **Subscribe to Test** button.

After you click on the button, you will need to choose a plan for the API. Click on the **Subscribe** button next to the plan that you want to use:

Once you have subscribed to an API, you can click on the **Endpoints** tab to view all the endpoints that the API provides:

Next, you can click on the **Test Endpoint** button for the endpoint that you want to test:

When the API request is successful, you will be able to view the **Results** tab, which will render the **Body** of the response:

Next, you can visit the **Code Snippets** tab and choose the appropriate language and library that you want to use:

<Callout>
	RapidAPI provides code snippets in 20 programming languages with support for
	40 libraries.
</Callout>

Next, you can copy and paste the code in your application, and it will just work.

If you are libraries for fetching data like [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), you will need to install them separately in your application.
