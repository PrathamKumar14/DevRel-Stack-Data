## What is a REST API?

A REST API is an API that follows the design principles of the REST (or REpresentational State Transfer) architecture.

REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform CRUD (or Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

| Name   | HTTP method |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Create | POST        |
| Read   | GET         |
| Update | PUT, PATCH  |
| Delete | DELETE      |

Click on the **Create new user** button in the component below to understand how to create, update, read and delete a resource via a REST API.
