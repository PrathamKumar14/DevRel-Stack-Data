RapidAPI also provides various options to secure your API endpoints.

## Firewall Settings

RapidAPI adds a unique `X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Secret` header on every API request. This header has a unique value for every API and if the value is invalid (missing or different), it can be assumed that it isn't coming from the RapidAPI infrastructure.

## Threat Protection

Threat protection **protects your API from SQL or Javascript injection attacks**. This protection is optional and is left to the provider to enable or disable.

When enabled, the `Content-Type` header must be specified if the request has a body. If the `Content-Type` header is not specified, the request will be blocked.

## Request Schema Validation

If enabled, RapidAPI will automatically validate a bunch of parameters like path, query and header during run time and block all invalid requests. This requires `Content-Type` header in requests with a body.

## Request Configurations

### Request Size Limit

This is the maximum allowed size of a request.

**It can be less than or equal to 50 MB**, which is the default value. If left empty or configured as 0, the default value is applied. The request size includes request line, header, and request body.

### Proxy Timeout Setting

This is the maximum allowed time for the RapidAPI Gateway to wait for a response.

**It can be less than or equal to 180 seconds**, which is the default value. If left empty or configured as 0, the default value is applied.
