### Queries

When requesting data from a GraphQL server, the client has to send some information to the server. Based on this information, the server will send the response. This information is known as a "query".

Click on the 'Fetch user' button in the component below to make your first GraphQL query.

<GraphQLAPI type="query" />

### Mutations

When you want to save data to a GraphQL server, you can use a "mutation". You can create, update, and delete data from a GraphQL server using mutations.

Click on the 'Create user' button in the component below to make your first GraphQL mutation.

<GraphQLAPI type="mutation" />
