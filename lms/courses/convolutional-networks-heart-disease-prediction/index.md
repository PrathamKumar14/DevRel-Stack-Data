title: Convolutional Networks for Heart Disease Prediction
slug: convolutional-networks-heart-disease-prediction
description: AlphaCare is an open-source project that Keshav Boudaria and I have been working on for the past few weeks, and it's built entirely on top of freely available open-source data, algorithms, and compute. In this first video of the AlphaCare series, I'll explain how we can use it to classify ECG data from patient heartbeats to accurately predict the likelihood of different types of heart disease, mainly Arrhythmia. The goal of AlphaCare is to progressively improve it's capabilities as a community until it's able to be used as a tool to treat and prevent the top 10 major disease globally. Ultimately, we'd like to use it to treat the root cause of all diseases, Aging. AlphaCare is a work in progress, we have a lot of work to do together. I can't wait to learn and grow with all of you, let's make a massive positive impact together!
