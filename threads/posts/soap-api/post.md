## Introduction to SOAP API

<Tweet>

SOAP is a necessary protocol that helped introduce the widespread use of APIs.

SOAP is the acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol.

<Tweet>

SOAP is a standardized protocol that relies on XML to make requests and receive responses.

Even though SOAP is based on XML, the SOAP protocol is still in wide usage.

SOAP API makes data available as a service.

It is typically used when performing transactions involving multiple API calls or applications where security is the primary consideration.

📌 History of SOAP API

SOAP was initially developed for Microsoft in 1998 to provide a standard mechanism for integrating services on the internet regardless of the operating system, object model, or programming language.

📌 Working of SOAP APIs

The “S” in SOAP stands for Simple, and for a good reason.

SOAP can be used with less complexity as it requires less coding in the app layer for transactions, security, and other functions.

SOAP has three primary characteristics: 👇🏻

</Tweet>

<Tweet>

1. Extensibility of SOAP API

SOAP allows for extensions that introduce more robust features, such as Windows Server Security, Addressing, and more.

2. Neutrality of SOAP API

SOAP is capable of operating over a wide range of protocols, like UDP, JMS, SMTP, TCP, and HTTP.can operate.

<Tweet>

3. Independence of SOAP API

SOAP API responses are purely based on XML. Therefore SOAP APIs are platform and language independent.

📌 When to Use SOAP API

Developers continue to debate the pros and cons of using SOAP and REST.

The best one for your project will be the one that aligns with your needs.

🔹 SOAP APIs remain a top choice for corporate entities and government organizations that prioritize security, even though REST has largely dominated web applications.

</Tweet>

<Tweet>

🔹 SOAP is more secure than REST as it uses WS-Security for transmission along with Secure Socket Layer.

</Tweet>

<Tweet>

🔹 SOAP also has more excellent transactional reliability, which is another reason why SOAP historically has been favored by the banking industry and other large entities.

📌 REST Vs. SOAP
 
SOAP is more secure than REST as it uses WS-Security for transmission along with a Secure Socket Layer.

SOAP is stateful (not stateless) as it takes the entire request as a whole. REST involves multiple methods while dealing with requests and responses.
