## API Attacks

<Tweet>

APIs are vulnerable to attacks and being hacked, just like many other structures on the web.

Here are five types of API attacks.

1️⃣ API injection attack.

Injection attacks work by inserting malicious code into the API via a query or request to obtain unauthorized access to data.

These are most commonly SQL injection attacks, which insert malicious SQL code as a parameter field.

2️⃣ DDoS (distributed denial of service attack).

This attack aims to disrupt a server with a large amount of traffic.

It essentially creates a traffic jam, with none of the traffic able to be transferred.

This can break the API by making it’s data inaccessible to users.

3️⃣ Data exposure.

The transfer of any data across the web is at risk of being stolen or hacked, which is why transferring encrypted data is so important.

4️⃣ MITM (man in the middle attack).

MITM attacks are when a hacker intercepts communication between two programs to obtain the information being transferred between them.

The risk of this is much greater if the data in transit is not encrypted.

5️⃣ Parameter tampering.

Parameter tampering aims to manipulate parameters sent in API requests, creating access to potentially sensitive information.

Parameter tampering is done mainly through input forms submitted by the user on the web.

With that being said, that's pretty much it for this thread.
