## Types of Web APIs

<Tweet>

There are four types of Web APIs: 

- Public API
- Private API
- Partner API
- Composite API

</Tweet>

1️⃣ Public API

Public APIs are accessible to all developers with a low or moderate level of authentication and authorization.

For example, the Windows API of Microsoft is a public API.

Stability is an essential factor of any public API.

Any changes in the public API, let's say adding a new parameter, might break the applications that depend on that API.

2️⃣ Private API

Private APIs, also known as Internal APIs, are only accessible to the developers within the organization or enterprise.

Private APIs serve the various features:

- Cross-department Data Access
- Building An App-Enabled Business
- Enabling Contractors to Build Features
- Manage supply chain efficiently

3️⃣ Partner API

Partner APIs are accessible to business partners.

They are not available publicly and need specific authentication to access them.

<Tweet>

4️⃣ Composite API

Composite API is a design approach in which we bundle multiple API requests into a single API call.

We can use the response body of one request as the input for the other request.

All the response bodies and the HTTP statuses are returned in a single response body.
