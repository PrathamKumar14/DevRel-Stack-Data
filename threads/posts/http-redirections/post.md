## Everything you need to know about HTTP redirections.

A particular webpage or website may have more than one URL. HTTP redirect responses belong to such kinds of applications.

Redirections are quite helpful in the following ways: üëáüèª

-   You can temporarily redirect while maintaining.
-   You can add a permanent redirect to the new URL so that the exciting link won't break.

HTTP has a dedicated responses series, which is 3xx, for redirection messages.

HTTP redirections are always handled on the server-side.

The server sends the 3xx status code along with the `Location` header.

`Location` header contains the redirect URL.

Browser simultaneously redirects to the URL specified in the `Location` header without any client input.

HTTP redirects can be

-   Temporary
-   Permanent
-   Special

### Permanent redirections

The old URL will never be used and it has been changed with the new URL.

There are two typical HTTP responses in permanent redirections:

1. 301 Moved Permanently
   Method and body might also be changed.

2. 308 Permanent Redirect
   Same method and body.

### Temporary redirections

Temporary redirections are widely used while maintaining the URL.

There are three typical HTTP responses in temporary redirections:

1. 302 Found
   Method may or may not be changed.

2. 303 See Other
   Method changed to GET.

3. 307 Temporary Redirect
   Method and body are the same.

Temporary redirections are widely used while maintaining the URL.

### Special redirections

There are certain scenarios when redirects happen which doesn't fall into permanent or temporary redirects.

For example, Caching and multiple choice.

There are two typical HTTP responses in special redirections:

1. 300 Multiple Choice
   Multiple options to respond.

2. 304 Not Modified
   Cache response can be used.
