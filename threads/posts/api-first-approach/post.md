## API-first approach

<Tweet>

Many developers and companies have been opting for the API-first approach in recent years. Let's try to understand it precisely.

The API-first approach ensures that all the functionality of an application is accessed through APIs.

This approach involves designing every API around a contract written in an API description language.

For example, OpenAPI Specification.

Following a standard API description language secures the reusability and consistency of an API.

Also, it provides well-documented, well-designed, and easy to integrate APIs.

API-first approach also provides better Developer Experience (DX), which is a massive advantage as APIs consumers are primarily developers.

The API-first approach deals with planning, testing, and designing, which saves developers from hours of debugging.
