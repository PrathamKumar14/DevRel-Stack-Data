## API makes developer life more effortless

<Tweet>

Let's first briefly discuss APIs.

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface.

In simple terms, API is an interface that lets your application talk to another application.

API is a set of definitions and protocols that allow technology products and services to communicate.

APIs are so powerful and help developers in four broader ways.

Let's discuss it down below. üëáüèª

1. APIs increase the development speed

Developers spend less time implementing trivial features and more time focusing on their important business.

Imagine you want to validate your email id when a user signs up in your application.

Building and maintaining an email validation service might be time-consuming. 

Wouldn‚Äôt you instead spend time improving your business or product?

Hence API increases development speed.

2. APIs reduce the overall software cost

Your development cost goes down when you need to implement and maintain less code (relying on APIs). It‚Äôs a classic Build vs. Buy argument.

3. APIs can increase the quality of the software

Each API component is developed by a business primarily focused on making it the best possible solution rather than one team that has to be good at many things.

Hence using a good API can make your software better.

4. APIs yield new possibilities

With APIs, developers can now integrate with data sets and implement features like AI and Machine Learning that they wouldn't have used before, creating new business opportunities.

With that being said, this is how API makes developers' life effortless.
