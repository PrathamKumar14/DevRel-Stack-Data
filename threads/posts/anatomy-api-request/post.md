## Anatomy of an API request

<Tweet>

There are four main components:

Method
Endpoint
Header
body/data

</Tweet>

<Tweet>

ðŸ“Œ Method

The Method is the type of request sent to a server, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

These requests are used to create four types of actions for data in the server. These actions are Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).

ðŸ“Œ Endpoint

The Endpoint is the URL that navigates to the specific data requested. 

Always check an API's documentation to use its endpoints correctly for the purpose of your project.

Endpoints can also have additional query parameters to narrow down the results they return.

ðŸ“Œ Header

API headers provide information about the request and response, such as response cookies, request authorization, content type, and more. 

They can be found in the response body.

Headers can help identify issues with a request or response.

ðŸ“Œ Body/Data

The body is the data that you want to send to the server. The body is usually a part of 'create' and 'update' methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
