Earlier, we discussed the [must-have elements of API Documentation](https://RapidAPI.com/guides/api-documentation); let’s demonstrate each of those documentation elements using RapidAPI Hub.

## Authentication Information

RapidAPI automatically gives your API both authentication and user management functionality. For developers consuming your API, this provides a seamless integration experience.

RapidAPI authentication allows developers to access all their APIs with a single RapidAPI key. Moreover, they can also test your API from a browser, subscribe with a single click, and start using your API without the friction of signing up for yet another account and getting API credentials.

Once the developers subscribe to your API, they can use the API key, which is clearly communicated in the parameters and the code snippets.

## Endpoint Definitions

You can specify information, descriptions, and external documentation links for each API endpoint in your API Dashboard.

![Adding Name and Description of Endpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/production/guides/posts/api-document-rapidapi-hub/images/add-endpoint.png)

So, you can easily show the following information about endpoints:

-   Request methods to call the endpoint, such as POST, GET, etc.
-   Endpoint URL.
-   Required and optional parameters for the endpoint.
-   Data returned by the endpoint in response.
-   A short non-technical description of what it does and how it relates to other endpoints.

Here is how the developers will see your endpoint definitions.

## Code Snippets

RapidAPI automatically generates code snippets for your API in multiple languages and libraries. You don't have to worry about creating them, as RapidAPI Hub uses the endpoint settings and other details to formulate them.

These code snippets embed the API key so that developers can start using your API quickly. This reduces the time to the first call, which is critical for good developer experience and API adoption.

## Example Responses and Error Logs

Sometimes, it is unclear what data we can get until we receive the API response. Even then, actual responses can be extensive, and it can be hard to decipher their structure. Good documentation includes example responses for each endpoint to show the users what to expect in return.

In the endpoints section of your API Dashboard, you can specify example responses for any endpoint. Following is a good example of such a response:

![Example Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/production/guides/posts/api-documentation/images/response.png)

As you can see, you can set example responses for multiple status codes. You can also display your error messages using error status codes like 500 to improve the documentation further.

## Detailed Docs

You can use the Docs section in your API Dashboard to add detailed documentation, external links, guides, and other resources.

![Adding Detailed Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/production/guides/posts/api-document-rapidapi-hub/images/docs.png)

The detailed docs will show up on your API’s page’s **About** section. This tab gives you a space for adding additional information such as Frequently Asked Questions without cluttering the documentation.

## Pricing and Terms of Use

You can specify pricing plans, limits, usage quotas, and terms of use for your API, which are neatly organized in a separate **Pricing** tab.
