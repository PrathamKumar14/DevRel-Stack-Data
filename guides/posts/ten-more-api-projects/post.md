<Lead>

APIs are a fundamental part of the web, and there are countless APIs providing access to all kinds of data for web applications.

</Lead>

The best way to learn web development and coding, in general, is by building projects to apply your knowledge. Today web applications are centered around the APIs they consume. Moreover, on the enterprise level, APIs are often designed before creating applications for different platforms.

Therefore, learning how to interact with APIs, send requests, handle their response, and manage errors are critical aspects of web development's learning curve. Before moving further, let's revise our concepts about APIs.

## API

The Application Programming Interface (API) is like a middle man, connecting two sides; a waiter takes your order and brings you food. It is a channel that applications utilize to talk with each other. You put some information at one end, the API takes that information and gets back with a result.

An API lets one application use the capabilities of another system. This means that if you want to build an e-commerce application, you can concentrate on building only your product. You can use the API of different applications for payments, billings, authentication, etc.

## Projects

In the [previous guide](), we discussed ten Web projects that use APIs, and this guide will cover some more exciting projects. Every project mentioned in this guide includes a deployed demo and a complete how-to-build guide. You can use these project ideas to improve your skills and showcase them in your developer portfolio.

This guide will present ten excellent web apps that use different APIs for data fetching. These examples use APIs to make applications that serve real use-cases. Every app has a detailed guide that demonstrates how to build it, which will help you get started right away.

### RapidAPI Hub

All these examples use APIs from [RapidAPI Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/hub?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel), the largest API marketplace which enables you to choose from thousands of public APIs for use in your projects.

### 1. Weather App

![Weather App built using Open Weather Map API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RapidAPI/DevRel-Stack-Data/production/guides/posts/build-weather-app/images/app.png)

In this project, we used the [Open Weather Map API](https://RapidAPI.com/community/api/open-weather-map/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel), which provides updated data regarding weather data for any location on earth. The weather data is based on data from more than 40,000 weather stations. So, the web application will allow users to search for the current weather in any city.
