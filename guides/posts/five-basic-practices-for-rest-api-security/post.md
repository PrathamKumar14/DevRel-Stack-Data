<Lead>

API security is becoming a major concern for developers day by day and it is essential to protect the data they transfer from security breaches. Representational state transfer (REST) API is the most common type of API. REST APIs allow you to create, read, update and delete operations between a client and a server. There are a number of ways to secure REST APIs.

Letâ€™s talk about five basic practices to secure a REST API. You can also learn about all the best practices for REST API security [in this guide](https://RapidAPI.com/guides/practices-rest-security?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel).

## Hashed Passwords

Passwords should always be hashed to secure the system even if it is under hacking attempts. This is one of the most common and easiest ways of protecting the REST API.

## Never Use Easily Exploitable URLs

Easily exploitable URLs include usernames, passwords, API keys, etc. All this information should not appear in the URL as it leads to hacking attempts.

## Using OAuth2

OAuth2 is a standard that explains how a third-party application can access data from an application on behalf of a user. It is a more general framework built primarily for authorization. This should be implemented to protect the REST API.

## Avoid Complex Security Techniques

Secure the REST APIs by using simpler techniques. The more you dig into the complex ones, you are more likely to leave holes that affect its overall security.

## Always Use Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS should be enforced as a standard for all APIs. It secures the information the API and the user sends by encrypting the messages in transit. TLS enabled websites URL start with `https://`. This way you will be able to secure your RESTful APIs.
