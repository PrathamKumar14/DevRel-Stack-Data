APIs can make the life of a developer very easy. External APIs provide a great amount of versatility. Let’s take a look at it.

## External APIs

External APIs are designed as per the needs of the external partners and third-party developers. The whole API publishing process is done on an external API portal, accessible to external partners and third-party developers.

It is also termed as a **Public** or **Open API** and is available for use by any outside developer or business. Internal developers can use External APIs as well.

External APIs make an organization's data and services easily accessible around the world and help developers create new applications. These APIs enhance partner business opportunities. These Public APIs generally require API Keys and security tokens to access them.
