<Lead>
	There are a lot of components that make an application. There is client-side
	code, server-side codebase, internal APIs, public APIs, microservices, etc.
	All these implementations work together and perform different operations.

Let’s shed some light on APIs, microservices, and the difference between these two.

## Application Programming Interface (API)

The API is like a middle man, connecting two sides; a waiter takes your order and brings you food. It is a channel that applications utilize to talk with each other. You put some information at one end, the API takes that information and gets back with a result.

Many different types of APIs exist. You can use them to build web, desktop, mobile applications, CLI tools, extensions, and much more.

## Microservices

A microservice is an individual service in the microservice architecture. Microservice is a Service-Oriented architecture where the functionality of the application is divided into small fragments. Maintaining a monolithic architecture becomes difficult as you add more functionality, and Microservices help you with this.

## APIs vs. Microservices

Let’s take a look at the differences between APIs and microservices:

| API                                                                                                          | Microservices                                                                                                                                                     |

| An API is a communication service used to send and receive data between client and server.                   | A microservice is an application design that breaks up a monolithic architecture into small, self-containing services.                                            |
| If an API is compromised, the hacker will have access to the information transmitted through it.             | With microservices, each service is autonomous and independent from one another. So even if it is compromised, it will ideally not affect the entire application. |
| If an API breaks, it will break the application along with it.                                               | If one microservice fails, it will not affect the whole application.                                                                                              |
| With APIs, you often decide the type you will implement and use the same API in the rest of the application. | Microservices provide flexibility, and the development team can implement them in any way they like.                                                              |
