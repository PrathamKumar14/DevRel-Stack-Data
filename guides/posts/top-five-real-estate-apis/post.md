## What is an API?

The Application Programming Interface (API) is like a middle man connecting two sides. It is like a waiter who takes your order and brings you food, connecting the guests with the kitchen. So, it provides a channel that applications utilize to talk with each other.

Today, countless APIs are available that provide access to all kinds of data. You can use them to build web, desktop, mobile applications, CLI tools, extensions, etc.
