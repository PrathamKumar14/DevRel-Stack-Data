## RapidAPI Developers Stories

<Tweet>

How did you start your API development journey?

</Tweet>

<DeveloperStories twitterUsername="ApiFootball" authorName="jérémy-gaudin">

It was initially a need of API on the sport for a site in construction, not finding API corresponding to my needs I decided to create one on measure, it is from there that I realized that there was little API on the sport containing the whole of the data which the users could seek or then these APIs were expensive.

During my research I often came across the "mashape.com" platform, formerly Rapidapi. Once my site and my API developed I put it online on Mashape then Rapidapi at a price suitable for all users.

How RapidAPI made your life as a developer easier?

</Tweet>

<DeveloperStories twitterUsername="ApiFootball" authorName="jérémy-gaudin">

This was a great help in the beginning because it was possible to monetize the API without having to create a website or a payment system for the API. The whole thing was managed by Rapidapi, which is really a plus when you're starting out because you can focus 100% on the development of the product and leave the selling and promotion to Rapidapi.

What other cool features would you like to see in RapidAPI as a product?

</Tweet>

<DeveloperStories twitterUsername="ApiFootball" authorName="jérémy-gaudin">

From an API provider point of view, it would be nice to have an API in order to be able to retrieve the data concerning one's account on Rapidapi in order to be able to retrieve the registered users, the payments or any other data that could be useful in statistical terms.

It would also be appreciated to improve the management of payments (several problems over the last 4/5 months).

The discussion part of the APIs should also be improved with the possibility to add moderators and to better follow the discussions. We receive an email when someone posts a question but we don't receive one when the same person writes another message in the discussion, which forces us to make daily checks to be sure not to miss a message.
