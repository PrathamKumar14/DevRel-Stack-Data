<Lead>

Developing a software interface that exposes backend data and application functionality to client-side is called API architecture. An API architecture consists of components for external interfacing, traffic control, runtime execution of business logic, and data access.

</Lead>

The architectural decisions taken while developing an API come under API Designing and are considered the first step in API development. Hence, API design and architecture influence users who use it and the revenue generated.

## API Architecture's Elements

API architecture is comprised of the following components:

API Portal - It is a component that serves as a portal between API Consumers and API Providers.
API Gateway - It is an API management tool that determines how clients interact with APIs through policies.

## API Architecture's Layers

### Information Management Layer

Managing and storing all the giant data repositories is the function of this layer. Information Management Layer is a reliable and high-performance data layer that keeps the data.

### Application Layer

All the applications that run your organization live in this layer.

### Integration Layer

The Integration Layer makes API integration easier for synchronous access to various services across disparate devices and users.

### Interaction Layer

In this layer, the applications and services used by your customers, partners, and employees interact with your business applications and data.

## Designing an API Architecture

For deploying a good API design, consider the following:

-   It should be **simple**.
-   It should be **flexible**.
-   It should provide **robust error handling**,
-   It should not compromise on **security**.

## Wrap Up

[RapidAPI Enterprise Hub](https://RapidAPI.com/products/enterprise-hub/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) is a white-labeled API hub that enables organizations to find, connect to, and manage hundreds of APIs across multiple teams and multiple API gateways.
