When building projects, we often require some random demo data to test our applications. This guide will cover some APIs we can use for getting random demo data.

</Lead>

The best way to learn web development and coding, in general, is by building projects to apply your knowledge. These random APIs will get you started by providing fake dummy data for use in your projects. So, you can develop your application without worrying about the actual data.

Here are some APIs that we can use for dummy data.

### 1. DBM API

Whether you want to create a streaming application or an e-commerce website, the [DBM API](https://rapidapi.com/alberto-zE9RMSlyY/api/dbm/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) offers extensive dummy data that you can use to test your application thoroughly. The API has dummy data for movies, places, products, and users. The dummy product data returned by this API looks like this.

```json
{
	"products": [
		{
			"tags": [],
			"_id": "618705bc8b76a09fc28d6b37",
			"name": "Chaz Kangeroo Hoodie-L-Orange",
			"sku": "MH01-L-Orange",
			"shortDescription": "This is a variable product called a Chaz Kangeroo Hoodie",
			"description": "Ideal for cold-weather training or work outdoors, the Chaz Hoodie promises superior warmth with every wear.",
			"countInStock": 50,
			"quantity": 5,
			"category": "Clothing",
			"categories": "Clothing>Men>Tops>Hoodies & Sweatshirts, Clothing>Collections>Eco Friendly, Clothing",
			"image": "http://eimages.valtim.com/acme-images/product/m/h/mh01-orange_main.jpg",
			"price": 24,
			"parent": "MH01",
			"rating": 1,
			"numReviews": 14,
			"availableSizes": ["L"],
			"availableColors": ["Orange"]
		}
	]
}
```

As you can see, you can efficiently utilize this data in an application to show demos and test your development.
