	XML and JSON are the two most common formats to receive data from the
	server. Before understanding the differences between these two, let’s see
	what they are first.

## JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a language-independent data-interchange format that uses human-readable text for storing and transmitting data objects. Its syntax is much more compact and has established semantics. JSON allows you to share key-value pairs, arrays, objects between the client and the server. Although it is derived from JavaScript, you can use it with almost any programming language.

## XML

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is another format designed to store data and transfer it across client and server. XML defines a set of rules for encoding data that is both human and machine-readable. The most basic unit in XML is an element, and you can define different markup elements and generate a customized markup language.

## Differences Between JSON And XML

Although both these formats are there to exchange data between client and server, they are entirely different from one another. The following are some of the differences between JSON and XML:

## Differences Between JSON And XML

Although both these formats are there to exchange data between client and server, they are entirely different from one another. The following are some of the differences between JSON and XML:

| JSON                                        | XML                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It has a type.                              | XML data is typeless.                                               |
| JSON types: string, number, array, Boolean. | All XML data should be a string.                                    |
| Data is readily accessible as JSON objects. | XML data needs to be parsed to use it.                              |
| It is easy to retrieve values from JSON.    | It often becomes tricky to get your desired data value.             |
| JSON has native support for objects.        | With XML, the objects have to be expressed by convention.           |
| There is no comment support.                | You can write comments in XML.                                      |
| Much easier to read than XML files.         | The files are generally difficult to read and interpret for humans. |
| It is less secure.                          | It is more secure than JSON.                                        |
| There is no support for the namespace.      | It supports namespace.                                              |
