## Security APIs

A couple decades ago, adding new features to your web application was only possible through coding the entire feature yourself and integrating it in the application. The rise of APIs has made this process much simpler, and today there are APIs serving all kinds of functions.

Implementing security features from scratch is not an easy feat, which is why we have hand picked some of the popular and notable security related APIs out there. You can easily integrate them in your applications to increase their security capabilities.

### 1. IP Geolocation API

[IP Geolocation API](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/ip-geo-location/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) looks up IP addresses of visitors and provides their geolocation information. The information includes country, city, latitude, longitude, timezone, asn, currency and other security data.

### 3. Telesign API

[Telesign API](https://rapidapi.com/telesign/api/telesign-sms-verify/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) is a great tool for adding phone-based verification and two-factor authentication to your application.

The API works using elementary logic. The developers embed the API in their apps or websites. When a new user is signing up for the website or appâ€™s services, the registration form requires that they input their mobile number. The API collects the mobile number and sends a verification code to the number that is provided. Then, the user enters this code to complete the registration process.
