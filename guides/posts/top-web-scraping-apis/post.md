	Web Scraping is an automated way of extracting data from a website. Web
	scraping has many important use-cases, but it can be challenging. These
	challenges include handling proxies, captchas, JavaScript rendering, and
	headless browsers. Web Scraping APIs allow developers to programmatically
	access the content on any website without worrying about these challenges.
