	API is a channel that applications utilize to talk with each other. You put
	some information at one end, the API takes that information and gets back
	with a result. This guide will focus on five APIs that provide
	security-related features.

## Security APIs

A couple of decades ago, adding new features to your web application was only possible through coding the entire feature yourself and integrating it into the application. The rise of APIs has made this process much more straightforward, and today there are APIs serving all kinds of functions.

Implementing security features from scratch is not an easy feat, which is why we mentioned five security APIs in our [previous guide](https://RapidAPI.com/guides/five-security-apis) and this guide would add five more notable security-related APIs. You can easily integrate them into your applications to increase their security capabilities.

### 1. Twilio Verify Phone Number API

[Twilio Verify Phone Number API](https://RapidAPI.com/twilio/api/twilio-verify-phone-number/?utm_source=RapidAPI.com/guides&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel) is an excellent tool for adding phone-based verification and two-factor authentication to your application by sending codes via text or voice.

The API works using elementary logic. The developers embed the API in their apps or websites. When a new user is signing up for the website or appâ€™s services, the registration form requires that they input their mobile number. The API collects the mobile number and sends a verification code to the provided number. Then, the user enters this code to complete the registration process.
