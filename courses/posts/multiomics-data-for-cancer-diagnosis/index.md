title: 'Multiomics Data for Cancer Diagnosis (AlphaCare: Episode 3)'
description: The amount of molecular biology datasets available are growing exponentially every month. Multiomics consist of all the layers of the molecular biome; the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. In this episode, we're going to learn how each of the layers of the molecular biology stack work, and then look at 3 different real world use cases for Cancer patients (diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive) using open-source python code on GitHub. Then we'll look at how a Generative Adversarial Network can be used to generate synthetic genomic data to battle imbalanced classes. Enjoy!
