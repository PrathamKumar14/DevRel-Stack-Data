title: 4 APIs at ONCE! | How To Manage Multiple APIs (Application Programming Interface)
description: Let's say you have an application that uses multiple APIs from various platforms. Each API has its own key and its own way of managing access. What if I told you that there's a platform where you can manage all of your APIs in one spot? We're going to build an app that consumes multiple APIs using RapidAPI to see how easy it is to use. We'll create a quick project by using Vite.js and Tailwind CSS, then use RapidAPI to connect to 4 APIs and consume their data.
